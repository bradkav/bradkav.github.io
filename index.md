I am a particle astrophysicist, working as a *Cient√≠fico Titular* (tenured scientist) at [IFCA](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us#) in Santander in Northern Spain. I was previously a post-doc at the [GRAPPA](https://iop.fnwi.uva.nl/grappa/) institute at the University of Amsterdam from September 2017 - February 2020. Before this, I was a post-doc at the [LPTHE](http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr) in Paris, holding a '*distinguished*' ERC NewDARK Fellowship with [Dr. Marco Cirelli](http://www.marcocirelli.net).

My main research interest is [Dark Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) and trying to find out what it is. On this website, you'll find information and useful links associated with my research.
