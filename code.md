## Code

All of my publicly available code can be found on github: {% include icon-github.html username="bradkav" %}.

I try to make my code publicly available wherever possible, both to encourage transparency and to encourage others to make the most use of the work I've already done. You can find below a brief summary of the release-version codes which I maintain on github.

Note that some of the code available on github is still under development and marked [\*\*Work in progress\*\*]. Although I guess when it comes down to it, it's all a work in progress.

**EarthShadow** {% include icon-github.html username="bradkav" %}/ [EarthShadow](https://github.com/bradkav/EarthShadow)
 
*A tool for calculating the effects of Earth-scattering on the distribution of Dark Matter (DM) particles (and the resulting impact on direct detection rates). Includes (Mathematica) code, numerical results, plots and animations.*

**runDM** - {% include icon-github.html username="bradkav" %}/ [runDM](https://github.com/bradkav/runDM)

*A tool (in Mathematica and Python) for calculating the running of the couplings of Dark Matter (DM) to the Standard Model (SM) in simplified models with vector mediators. Useful for exploring the complementarity between DM direct detection (low energy) and LHC searches (high energy).*

**DiphotonFits** - {% include icon-github.html username="bradkav" %}/ [DiphotonFits](https://github.com/bradkav/DiphotonFits)

*DiphotonFits is a collection of Python code (and a couple of data files) which allows you to perform fits to the (binned, digitised) ATLAS diphoton invariant mass spectrum, from the initial Run-II results (Dec 2015). Essentially a worked example in statistics, allowing you to reproduce the results of [arXiv:1601.07330](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07330).*
