### <a id="code"></a>Code

All of my publicly available code can be found on github: {% include icon-github.html username="bradkav" %}.

Note that some of the code available on github is still under development (and marked [\*\*Work in progress\*\*]). 

I try to make my code publicly available wherever possible, both to encourage transparency and to encourage others to make the most use of the work I've already done. Below is a brief summary of the release-version codes which I maintain on github:

**runDM** - {% include icon-github.html username="bradkav" %}/[runDM](https://github.com/bradkav/runDM)

*A tool for calculating the running of the couplings of Dark Matter (DM) to the Standard Model (SM) in simplified models with vector mediators.*

**ATLASfits** - {% include icon-github.html username="bradkav" %}/[ATLASfits](https://github.com/bradkav/ATLASfits)

*ATLASfits is a collection of python code (and a couple of data files) which allows you to perform fits to the (binned, digitised) ATLAS diphoton invariant mass spectrum, from the initial Run-II results released in December 2015.*


**EarthShadow** {% include icon-github.html username="bradkav" %}/[EarthShadow](https://github.com/bradkav/EarthShadow)
 
*The EarthShadow code is currently under development. It is based on the calculations and results of an upcoming paper investigating the scattering of Dark Matter particles which pass through the Earth.*

### <a id="notes"></a>Notes

Here I'll upload some useful notes. These will probably be summaries of useful results, or more careful calculations (which aren't always given in full in publications, but which turn out to be helpful).
