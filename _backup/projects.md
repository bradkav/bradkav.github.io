### Earth-Scattering of Dark Matter

<details>
  <summary> <em>Earth-Scattering of SIMPzillas</em> </summary>
  Very heavy, very strongly-interacting Dark Matter could evade current constraints as it very quickly loses energy while travelling through the atmosphere and the Earth. I'm performing some careful calculations of this Earth-Stopping effect for very heavy (> 10 TeV) Dark Matter, to determine precisely where the current limits from shallow-site direct detection experiments are cut off and therefore which regions of parameter space remain open.

  <summary> <em>Measuring the local Dark Matter density with Earth-Scattering</em> </summary>
  When Dark Matter is detected in terrestrial direct detection experiments, determining its local density and interaction cross section separately will be very difficult; each simply rescales the overall event rate. However, if DM is light and interacts very strongly, it may scatter in the Earth, causing the event rate to vary with time as the Earth rotates. The size of this modulation effect only depends on the interaction cross section, not the overall density of DM. Looking at a number of benchmark parameter points, I am aiming to demonstrate that (in this regime) it is possible to break the degeneracy between the local density and cross section using this effect.
