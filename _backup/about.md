I am currently a post-doc at the [LPTHE](http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr) in Paris, holding a *distinguished* ERC NewDARK Fellowship with [Dr. Marco Cirelli](http://www.marcocirelli.net).

I completed my PhD in 2014 at the University of Nottingham, supervised by [Dr. Anne Green](http://anne-green.net/physics/Home.html). My thesis was entitled "*Confronting astrophysical uncertainties in the direct detection of dark matter*" and is available from the [Nottingham eTheses Repository](http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14547/).

I work on Dark Matter (DM) phenomenology. I have specialised in looking at the possible signatures of DM in Direct Detection experiments, which search for the low energy interactions of Galactic DM with nuclei in dedicated detectors. I am particularly interested in how different models of DM (and in particular different DM-nucleon interactions) can be distinguished in direct detection experiments, as well as in indirect and collider searches. This information should prove vital for informing future decisions about what type of detectors while give us the greatest handle on the properties of DM and the greatest chance of unveiling its identity.
